# Arduino-based Object Detection System

## Description
A real-time object detection system developed using Arduino and ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Jumper wires

## Working
The ultrasonic sensor measures distance and detects objects in real time based on a predefined threshold.

## Output
